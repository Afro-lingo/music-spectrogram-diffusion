# A gin file to make the Transformer models tiny for faster local testing.
#
# When testing locally with CPU, there are a few things that we need.
# - tiny model size
# - small enough batch size
# - small sequence length
# - determinstic dataset pipeline
#
# This gin file adds such configs on top of the 'small' configuration.
